# Unhedged
## Overview and Origin
* Unhedged was founded in 2020. It was co-founded by serial entrepreneur and prolific algorithm builder Peter Bakker as well as Mike Cohen, who has spent 10 years in management consulting in financial risk management and digital transformation for Deloitte,KPMG and  Macquarie Bank.
* While working for hedge funds, investment banks and top tier consultants, the pair realised that everyday investors didn’t have access to advanced investment tools and wanted to create an app to address this.
* Unhedged has raised just over $1.7 million in equity crowdfunding, having passed its minimum target of $350,000 within just 45 minutes. Peter Bakker has personally sunk nearly $400,000 into the app-based technology
## Business Activities:
* Australia is nation of investors with close to 9 million adult Australians holding investments outside their super and primary dwelling.
More than half have investments in direct shares and there has been an increase of new investors. Close to a quarter of all investors have started investing in the past 2 years 
* The problem Unhedged plans to solve is that new investors don’t always have the time or energy to learn advanced investment strategies and are therefore robbed from above-average returns. Unhedged plans to change this by designing a simple app-based experience that allows everyday investors to assign their money to advanced AI trading algorithms to access higher performance
* By using an AI trading algorithm instead of a traditional fund manager, asset under management (AUM) fees can be lower as there is less salaries to pay.
* Unhedged boasts two different types of algorithms investors can choose from;
### Momentum Algorithm
* The momentum algorithm works on the asssumption that stocks that go up for a bit will go up longer, and stocks that go down for a while will continue to do so.
Every day Unhedged scans 8,000 stocks and selects the best based on fundamental factors.
### Turtle and the Hare Algorithm (AKA the Robust Hierarchical Risk Parity Algorithm)
* This algorithm is based on research by Quant of the Year Marcos Lopez de Prado, who discovered that one should create clusters of stock that behave the same (which are highly correlated). Unhedged uses this principle to determine the trend of the market.

## Landscape:
* Unhedged is a type of Robo-advisor.
* Robo-advisors are classified as a type of software designed to do what human investment brokers and wealth managers do except better. They use investment algorithms, to analyse millions of data points and spread an investor’s money across the most appropriate investments, and make adjustments to maintain an optimal portfolio based on their financial goals.
* Robo-advisors have been around since the early 2000s, but it wasn’t available to the average investor. That was until the first robo-advisor app,  Betterment, launched in the US in 2008 and started taking investments in 2010.
* Robo-advice is revolutionising the market. In Australia alone, it’s predicted investments managed by robo-advisors will reach US$5.6 billion in 2021 and grow to $21.2 billion by 2025.
* Unhedged is designed to take on Australian industry heavyweights Stockspot, Six Park and Raiz. Unhedged main selling points to eager investors is its new type of fee model where fees will only charged when it outperforms the market and its intuitive and easy to use app.
## Results
* The company is yet to launch their app, but have over 8000 members on a waiting list and as previously mentioned have raised just over $1.7 million in equity crowdfunding
* The company used historical data to backtest test their algorithms, the results follow;
#### Momentum Algorithm

#### Turtle and the Hare Algorithm (AKA the Robust Hierarchical Risk Parity Algorithm)

* Both algorithms have out paced the market in recent years but as can be seen historically some years it underperforms the market
* These algorithms can be compared to one of unhedged competitors Stockspot. Stockspot is Australia's first and largest Robo-advisor. One of Stockspot's best performing algorithm is 'Topaz' and its historical performance can be seen below.

* Converting those returns into a percentage, since 2014 'Topaz' has deilevered a return of approximately 100%. During that same timeframe Unhedged's momentum alogorithm increases from 150% to approximately 500%, a 333.33% return. Unhedged's Turtle and the Hare Algorithm increases from 125% to approximately 250%, a 100% return.


## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?
(This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
